        I recently graduated from FEU Institute of Technology with a degree in
        Computer Science.

        I’m an aspiring software developer who loves bringing together design
        and tech. I enjoy using my technical skills and eye for design to build
        great looking, smooth, and scalable apps that offer top-notch user
        experience.

      <p>
        When I’m not coding, I’m probably playing video games, eating, or
        shooting some hoops.
